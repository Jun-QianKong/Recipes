# About

The focus for this project was to work with the skills I have built up so far with html.
This includes hyperlink references, ordered and unordered lists and general elements.

# What's Next

Further down the line, this project will be renovated (hopefully) with added css knowledge.
If applicable, there may be opportunities to use the MERN stack to create an interactive 
forum.
